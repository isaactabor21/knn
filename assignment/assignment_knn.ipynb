K-Nearest Neighbor Prediction Algorithm can be used for regression. The Nearest Neighbor Regression Algorithm first computes the distance from  $\\hat{x}$ to each observation $x_i$. Then, it finds the $k$ \"nearest neighbors\" $x_1^*$, $x_2^*$, ..., $x_K^*$ to $\\hat{x}$ in the data, with outcomes $y_{1}^*$, $y_2^*$, ..., $y_K^*$.

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*   A **confusion table** is a cross-tabulation of predicted and actual values. It is the fundamental quantity of interest we have for classification when it comes to fitting the model well and helping us understand a *model's performance. * We can use it to look for patterns in the successes and failures. This is an example of a confusion table for positive or negative for a medical condition:\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",

Often, this is written more compactly in vector notation as $||y-\\hat{y}||^2$: The squared norm of the distance between $y$ and $\\hat{y}$. It is the sum of squared errors. Errors, or residuals, quantifies how far off the $i$-th prediction is from the actual value. We have a residual for each observation $i$, and so the SSE aggregates all those errors into metrics of model performance. This is important because residuals is the fundamental quantity of interest we have for regression when it comes to fitting the model well and helping us understand a model's peformance.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Overfitting** is essentially making your model unrealistically *precise*. For example, with k-NN, if you pick too small of hyperparameter k such as only 2 neighbors, your model will likely be overfitting. That is, it will have low bias, but high variance in the predictions. It is not really considering that there are a lot of unpredictable factors affecting the real-world phenomenon.\n",
        "*   **Underfitting** is essentially making your model unrealistically *imprecise*. For example, with k-NN, if you pick too big of a hyperparemeter k such as 470 neighbors, your model will likely underfit. That is, it will have high bias, but low variance in the predictions. Your model is too simple to reliably explain the phenomenon you are interested in. Your model turned to mush, and instead of using local information, you're using \"most of the data\", and the predictions will tend towards the sample average.\n",

        "\n",
        "5. Why does splitting the data into training and testing sets, and choosing $k$ by evaluating accuracy or SSE on the test set, improve model performance?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Splitting the data into training and testing sets** improves model performance because the fundamental idea behind machine learning and data science is that we want to use existing data to build a model that can predict what will happen tomorrow. However, to model that kind of uncertainty and validate whether the model is any good, I need data that my model has never seen, so splitting the sample into two or more chunks or folds, holding out some data from the training of the model to instead test its performance allows us to create a sample of data the model has never seen. As long as the data generating process in the future is like the data generating process in the past, performance on the hold-out data mimics future performance. Whenever we split the sample, we're substituting **uncertainty about future predictions** for **uncertainty about the hold-out data** in order to test the model. So, a simple and effective data-driven strategy that is done to do this is to randomly split the data into two sets, a training set and a test/validation set. For a reasonable range of values, we make a prediction using the training set for each observation in the test set, and then we compute the squared difference from the prediction to the true outcome for each point in the test set, then sum to get the sum of squared error (SSE). Then, we pick the $k$ that achieves the lowest SSE.\n",
        "*   **Choosing $k$ by evaluating accuracy or SSE on the test set** improves model performance because you are using \"unseen\" data to find a good $k$ for future unseen data, but you have to be careful because doing this could lead to overfitting where you are really just finding the best k for the quirks of the test set, which might not actually mimic real life unseen data well.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Reporting a class label as a prediction** is that it is straightforward. Your result is either \"Yes\" or \"No.\" A weakness is you lose information about the uncertainty in the prediction.\n",
        "*   **Reporting a probability distribution** is generally stronger in that it helps you understand the uncertainty in the prediction. For example, it is very unsettling for someone to receive the class label prediction of \"You have cancer\" when the reality is that it is like 51% chance you have cancer, 49% you do not have cancer. Either way, you should definitely get tested, but that is very different then a report of a class label that \"you have cancer\" where it is 99% \"You have cancer\" and 1% \"you do not have cancer.\" A weakness is that it may not be as straightforward as just reporting the class label.\n",
